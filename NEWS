telepathy-qt4-yell 0.1.x
=========================

Enhancements:

Fixes:
 * Report the connection status reason using the Connection object if possible
 * On connection invalidated, emit the connection status changed signal to make sure the account model item is updated
 * Add constructor to Tpy::ContactCapabilities so it can be really used

 * WARNING: optimization of flat model proxy, dataChanged signal is not hierarchical anymore after we found out it was quite expensive. You need to do explicit hierarchical changes.
 * Added hierarchicalDataChanged signal to Tpy::AccountsModel for explicit signalling of changes in account data affecting contacts data (expensive)
 * When setting status and statusMessage on Tpy::AccountsModelItem do not clear the presence type
